# üõí Ecommerce Behavior Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard to analyze and predict customer behavior from a large-scale ecommerce dataset. This project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and predictive modeling using machine learning.

---

## üìå Why This Project?

Understanding online customer behavior is essential for any ecommerce platform. This dashboard helps answer critical business questions:
- Who are the potential buyers?
- What behaviors lead to a purchase?
- Which products and brands are most popular?
- How can we use data to boost sales?

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Preview of 20M+ ecommerce events
- Hourly event timeline visualization
- Top categories & brands
- Event type distribution with plots

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
- User-level aggregation of views, carts, and purchases
- Feature engineering: `view_to_cart`, `cart_to_purchase`, etc.
- KMeans clustering with interactive visuals

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**
- Target: Will a user purchase or not?
- Features: event behavior, price, sessions, and more
- Model: XGBoost with SMOTE to handle class imbalance
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, ROC AUC score
- Model comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Explainability: SHAP feature importance
